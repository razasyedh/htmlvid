# Modes
  b:v only: average bitrate mode
  b:v w/ minrate+maxrate: constant bitrate mode
  crf only: constant quality mode
  crf and b:v: b:v has no effect for MP4 and needed for max bitrate for webm
  constant quality mode is reccomended for libpvx

# TODO

  subprocess failing because it can't find the file if it's a relative path.
  give twopass file a name and just delete it after. same with vstats. no need for temp folder. OR append current directory? (os.getcwd())
  mp4 bitrate has no effect when using -crf

  take away bitrate option?

  conflict between option set in config and when conflicting option used in command line

  code to check if the user has python installed and in their PATH
  Might not need it:
    env: python: No such file or directory
    windows users would need to call python first (include in FAQ)
  check if FFmpeg installed and in path?
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/377017/test-if-executable-exists-in-python
    subprocess raises OSError No such file or directory but will fail silently on windows if exe is not found.

  linux + mac binaries doesn't contain ffprobe ... use ffmpeg -i ??

  mp4 size with -l is a bit high. (also, compensate for sound)
  683k - 128k (desired audio bitrate) = 555k video bitrate
  -b:a 128k # Acceptable values: 128/160/192/320

  try different thread numbers webM supposedly can't be 0
  \r might not work on windws. might need it on the end
  test that milliseconds work

  calculate_duration() weird behaviour with millisecond values. 5.5 counts as 5.005

  embed filter (extract the subs) (libass needed?) and others. Make the '0' argument optional?
  fix what prints during each verbosity level and simplify the verbose code.
      maybe a function that takes verbosity level. should print to stderr. make verbose a number instead
  remove default width??
  option to take snapshot at time? should require -s (-vframes dur out%02d.jpg)

  option to mux in sound?
  option to chose which audio track to include?

(ffmpeg -buildconf 2>NULLDEVICE) put info in epilog and verbose. ENABLE_FLAGS_CHECK
package using pyinstaller or pyexe

  gif support???
  Option to upload result to gfycat/mediacrush?
      http://www.gfycat.com/api
      https://mediacru.sh/docs/api

sub-commands to concat/cut/convert_to_gif??
